# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis_19



The Purpose

To Process Data for a Neural Network Model

Beks is tasked with the challenge of helping the foundation predict where to make investments.  As a student I am helping Beks with the knowledge of machine learning and neural networks to provide dataset in creating a binary classifier capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The Analysis

Using the information provided in the Starter Code, I was able to read I the charity_data.csv to a Pandas dataFrame to identify the variables for the targets and features for the model. Created a density plot that determined the distribution of the column values and merged the DataFrame

 
The standardized numerical variables were used by introducing the 
Scikit-Learn’s while scaling the Data.  The variables are:
	Application Type
	Affiliation
	Classification
	Organization
	Income Amount, and
	
	Special Consideration


 

The Data was compiled, trained and evaluated with TensorFlow to design a neural network, by creating binary classification model for prediction, which calculated the model’s loss and accuracy.  TensorFlow was utilized to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.  At this point, it was difficult with my model to achieve 75% or higher but I tried three times and the highest percentage is 69%. 

Sigmoid model was used to classify the first, second and outer layer

 



Result

TensorFlow was utilized to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.  At this point, it was difficult with my model to achieve 75% or higher but I tried three times and the highest percentage is 69%. 

The model was optimized by attempting three times, but the accuracy did not increase.
